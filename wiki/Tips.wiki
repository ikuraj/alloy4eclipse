#summary Some tips to improve user experience.
#labels Featured,Phase-Support

= Editor =

  * Just hover an error or warning marker to see the message instead of going to the problems view.

= Commands =

  * A double click on a command in the commands view will execute that command.

= Compiling and tracking errors =

  * The current alloy file will be compiled as it is saved.  Allows much more rapid feedback of errors.

  * Only a single error is usually shown, due to the way the Alloy compiler works.  Correct this to see the next error.  Multiple warnings will be shown, however.

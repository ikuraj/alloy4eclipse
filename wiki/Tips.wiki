= Editor =

  * Just hover an error or warning marker to see the message instead of going to the problems view.

= Commands =

  * A double click on a command in the commands view will execute that command.

= Compiling and tracking errors =

  * The current alloy file will be compiled as it is saved.  Allows much more rapid feedback of errors.

  * Only a single error is usually shown, due to the way the Alloy compiler works.  Correct this to see the next error.  Multiple warnings will be shown, however.

= Errors are not detected properly =

Users of the initial versions of the plugin (pre 0.0.6 releases) might notice that the "compile on save" feature is not working properly or at all in their existing projects.
This is due to the way "compile on save" feature was implemented in the initial releases of the plugin: it was not using the expected Eclipse building feature.

An Alloy Builder was introduced in release 0.0.6.

You can add the Alloy Builder to an older Alloy project by using the "Add/Remove Alloy Project Nature" in the contextual popup menu of the project.

You can check that your project has the correct builders by taking a look at the builders tab in the project properties (available from the project contextual menu too).
